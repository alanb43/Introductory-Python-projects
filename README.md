# Introductory-Python-projects
A bunch of projects I had worked on for an introductory coding course using Python, most of which involves data handling and manipulation through lists, dictionaries, and other data types.

The grading for these projects was done through mimir, and if I was stuck at some points course teaching assistants were available to help in the 'help room', which helped me through the occasional tough mental block throughout the course's projects, more so regarding the harder projects opposed to the introductory ones.

Prior to this course, I had no Python experience. I received full marks on every project (except project 2 because I forgot a file header). With this being said, these were introductory level projects, and I cannot wait to develop a stronger and more diversified understanding of Python!
